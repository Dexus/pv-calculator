# Changelog – PV Calculator (Dexus Overlay)

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and
the project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

The two artefacts versioned here are:

- **App** (`app/flutter_app/pubspec.yaml`) — user-facing Flutter app.
- **Engine** (`packages/pv_engine/pubspec.yaml`, `kEngineVersion`) — pure-Dart
  simulation library that the app depends on via path.

The About dialog in the app surfaces `appVersion (engine kEngineVersion)`
so a deployed scenario can be tied to an exact engine revision (PRD NFR-05).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.0] — 2026-05-18 (app) / [0.10.0] — 2026-05-18 (engine)

Phase 10 — CSV load-profile import. Plus two deferred items picked up:
Phase 8 structured engine warnings and the Phase 9 C4b buffer-column
aggregator refactor.

### Added — Engine
- **`parseLoadProfileCsv`** in `lib/src/load_profile_csv.dart` — pure-
  Dart parser for Smartmeter / Home Assistant / Shelly CSV exports.
  Auto-detects delimiter (`;`, `,`, tab), header row, and value column
  kind (power W/kW or energy Wh/kWh, inferred from header annotations
  and value magnitude). Sub-hourly samples aggregate into 24 hourly
  buckets and multi-day inputs average into one representative day.
  ISO 8601 timestamps with timezone offsets are parsed by wall-clock
  components so the recorded local hour is preserved.
- **`SimulationWarning`** + **`SimulationConfigWarnings.nonBlockingWarnings()`**
  — engine-side design rules (inverter oversizing, bank-vs-battery
  discharge cap, deep min-SOC). Emits stable codes plus structured
  args; the UI maps each code to its form section and appends the
  one UI-only hint (`irradiance-missing`) that depends on a draft
  cache the engine doesn't see. A future backend can now surface the
  same warnings without spinning up the UI layer.

### Changed — Engine
- **`SummaryAggregator` reads `_StepBuffer` columns directly** when
  the input is the `_StepListView` returned by `SimulationResult.steps`.
  Achieved by converting `summary_aggregator.dart` into a `part of`
  file so the engine-private buffer stays internal. Plain
  `List<SimulationStep>` inputs (hand-crafted in tests) still take
  the unchanged list-fallback path. Benchmark:
  `monthly + bankRuntime` over 35 040 quarter-hourly steps drops
  from ~10.5 ms to ~0.4 ms on the same desktop (~27× faster) — the
  Phase 9 C4b deferred item is now closed.
- Engine version bumped `0.9.0 → 0.10.0`.

### Changed — App
- **`LoadSection`** grows an "**CSV importieren**" button next to the
  daily-kWh field; importing replaces both `dailyKwh` and the hourly
  shape, and the hint text switches to a one-line summary that calls
  out the imported peak hour. Translations added in de/en/es/fr.
- **`FileIo.importLoadProfileCsv`** wraps the parser and the
  `file_selector` flow (1 MB cap, mirrors the existing
  `importConfig` pattern).
- **`ConfigDraft.validationWarnings()`** delegates the three
  arithmetic rules to `build().nonBlockingWarnings()` and only
  appends the `irradiance-missing` UI-only hint locally. Existing
  widget tests pass unchanged because codes and arg keys are
  byte-identical.
- App version bumped `0.4.0 → 0.5.0`.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-05-18 (app) / [0.9.0] — 2026-05-18 (engine)

Phase 10 — Multi-year simulation, tariff model & PDF reports.

### Added — Engine
- **`SimulationConfig.simulationYears`** (default `1`, max `30`). When
  `> 1`, the engine runs the existing per-year linear path once per
  year with each array's `peakKw` derated by
  `(1 - degradationPctPerYear/100)^year` and the SOC ledger carried
  across year boundaries. The configured warm-up (singleWarmUp) runs
  once in year 0 only. Schema bump to v4 only when a multi-year or
  degradation knob is non-default.
- **`PvArray.degradationPctPerYear`** (default `0.0`). Annual module
  power loss in %/year; only effective with `simulationYears > 1`.
- **`SimulationSummary.perYearSummaries`** (default `[]`). Length
  equals `simulationYears` for multi-year runs, empty otherwise. The
  top-level summary is the scalar sum across all years.
- **`SimulationSummary.toJson` / `fromJson`** — engine-side
  serialisation so per-year detail survives a persistence round-trip.
- **`TariffConfig`** in `lib/src/tariff.dart`: flat €/kWh import /
  export prices plus optional 24-slot time-of-use schedules.
  Validated for non-negative prices and length 24.
- **`SimulationConfig.tariff`** (nullable). When non-null, the
  simulator multiplies finalised `gridImportKwh`/`gridExportKwh` by
  the per-hour tariff slot **after** dispatch step 6 — the locked
  1..6 dispatch order is preserved. Schema v5 is emitted only when a
  tariff is configured.
- **`SimulationSummary.importCostEur` / `exportRevenueEur` /
  `netCostEur`** — nullable cashflow KPIs, populated whenever a
  tariff is configured.

### Changed — Engine
- `keepSteps: true && simulationYears > 1` retains only the final
  year's per-step data. Concatenation across years would corrupt
  `SummaryAggregator.monthly`'s `dayOfYear` keying.
- Engine version bumped `0.7.0 → 0.8.0` (multi-year + degradation)
  then `0.8.0 → 0.9.0` (tariff model & cashflow KPIs).

### Added — App
- **Simulationsjahre NumberField** in the Auswertung tab's
  simulation-parameters tile, behind the existing `kProFeatures`
  Pro flag. Disabled with a `(Pro)` suffix in free builds.
- **Per-array `degradationPctPerYear` NumberField** in the PV-Arrays
  tab — shown unconditionally since `0.0` is a no-op default.
- **`TariffSection`** in `widgets/forms/tariff_section.dart`: master
  enable switch, flat €/kWh fields (Free), and a 24-slot TOU grid
  (Pro-only, behind `kProFeatures`).
- **Cashflow KPIs** (`Bezugskosten`, `Einspeise-Erlös`,
  `Netto-Stromkosten`) rendered on the Auswertung tab when a tariff
  is configured.
- **PDF report export (Pro)** — `services/pdf_report.dart` builds an
  A4 report with title block, KPI summary, per-year breakdown,
  monthly table, PV arrays, micro-inverter bank coverage, warnings,
  and an AGPL footer (plus a synthetic-irradiance disclaimer when
  applicable). New "Bericht exportieren (PDF)" button on the
  Auswertung tab; disabled with a `(Pro)` tooltip in free builds.
- Adds `package:pdf` and `package:printing` as Flutter-app-only
  dependencies; engine remains zero-runtime-dep.

### Changed — App
- `_ResultsBody` accepts injected `proFeatures` and `onSharePdf` so
  widget tests can flip the gate without `--dart-define`.
- `NumberField` gains an `enabled` flag for the new Pro gates.
- Persistence helpers in `simulation_run_repository.dart`
  serialise `SimulationSummary.perYearSummaries` so multi-year
  scenario runs survive in `simulation_runs.summary_json`.
- App version bumped `0.3.0 → 0.4.0`.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-18 (app) / [0.7.0] — 2026-05-18 (engine)

Phase 9 — Performance & 15-Minute Resolution.

### Added — Engine
- **`SimulationProgress` + `onProgress` callback** on `PvSimulator.run`.
  Emits one event per simulated day (pre-run + reporting) with phase,
  completed/total days and (for `cyclicConvergence`) the iteration index.
  Drives the UI progress bar; engine stays Flutter-free.
- **`SolarPosition` + `solarPositionFor()`** — public helpers for the
  per-(day, hour, lat, lon) solar geometry. `transposeToPoa` accepts a
  precomputed `solarPosition` to skip the internal trig.
- **`SimulationConfig.keepSteps`** (default `true`). When `false`, the
  simulator skips retaining per-step records — annual KPIs are still
  produced but `SimulationResult.steps` is empty. JSON emits the field
  only when non-default so pre-Phase-9 round-trips and `inputHash` stay
  byte-identical.

### Changed — Engine
- **15-min step width verified end-to-end.** `TimeStep.quarterHourly`
  was already plumbed; this release adds the parity test (60-min and
  15-min summaries agree to ≤ 1e-9 kWh on piecewise-constant inputs) and
  documents the load-profile + weather-source quantisation behaviour.
- **Solar-geometry cache in `HorizontalToPoaSource`.** Each step's
  arrays share the cached zenith/azimuth instead of recomputing trig
  per array. The source now carries an 8760-slot cache invalidated on
  latitude change.
- **`_summarize` reads from an in-loop accumulator** instead of folding
  over the kept-steps list. Combined with `keepSteps: false` this drops
  ~35,040 `SimulationStep` allocations for batch comparisons.
- Engine version bumped `0.6.0 → 0.7.0` (new public API: `SimulationProgress`,
  `SolarPosition`, `keepSteps`).

### Added — App
- **Simulation runs in a worker isolate** on native; **stays in-process**
  on web (no isolates available). `SimulationRunner` owns the boundary;
  controllers (`ProjectController.run`, `ScenarioComparisonController`)
  switched to `async` and bridge engine progress to the UI.
- **Determinate progress bar** under the Run button on the Auswertung tab,
  with phase label (pre-run / reporting / cyclic-iteration N).
- **In-memory result cache** (size 3) in `ProjectController`, keyed on
  `(inputHash, engineVersion)`. Repeated Run on an unchanged draft
  returns instantly.

### Changed — App
- App version bumped `0.2.0 → 0.3.0`.

### Benchmarks (engine, this dev machine, 3 arrays × 365 days)
- Pre-Phase-9 baseline:           hourly 64.8 ms,  quarterHourly 251.2 ms
- After C3 (solar geometry):      hourly 60.2 ms,  quarterHourly 225.5 ms
- After C4 (accumulator):         hourly 55.7 ms,  quarterHourly 219.1 ms
- After C4a (Float64List buffer): hourly 41.0 ms,  quarterHourly 170.8 ms

Cumulative ~37 % faster hourly, ~32 % faster quarter-hourly. The
allocation-pressure win matters more than the wall-clock number: the
hot loop no longer allocates 35 040 `SimulationStep` objects and
~245 000 unmodifiable `List<double>` wrappers per quarter-hourly
year, which is exactly the GC pressure that hides on a fast desktop
and surfaces as jank on a mid-range smartphone.

Report-render cost is now well off the critical path:
- `monthly + bankRuntime` over a 35 040-step result: ~10.5 ms desktop.

A new manual `dart run benchmark/year_sim.dart` harness captures these
numbers reproducibly. It runs both `keepSteps: true` and `false` for
each `TimeStep`, plus the report-render cost.

### Verschoben (Phase 9)
- **Column-reading `SummaryAggregator`** (the originally planned C4b).
  Measured cost of the existing list-iterating path on the columnar
  buffer is ~10.5 ms desktop / ~50–100 ms mobile estimate for one full
  monthly + bankRuntime render — 6 % of the simulator runtime and well
  inside the 5 s budget. Refactoring `SummaryAggregator.monthly /
  bankRuntime / bankDaily` to read `_StepBuffer` columns directly would
  require either making `StepBuffer` public API or restructuring
  `lib/src/summary_aggregator.dart` as `part of pv_engine.dart`.
  Re-open if a Phase 10 feature (mehrjährige Simulation, Optimierer-
  Sweep, multi-scenario dashboard) starts running the aggregator
  hundreds of times per session, or mobile profiling shows the render
  path itself as the bottleneck.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-15 (app) / [0.6.0] — 2026-05-15 (engine)

### Added — App
- **Quick-Start Wizard** in the projects tab — 5-step `Stepper`
  (Standort → PV-Array → optional Speicher → Lastprofil → Zusammenfassung)
  that prefills `ConfigDraft` for `+ Neues Projekt`. Each step now wraps
  its inputs in a `Form` with `autovalidateMode: onUserInteraction` so
  Continue stays disabled while any visible field shows a validation
  error.
- **Expertenmodus** toggle in Settings (default OFF, persisted via
  `pv_expert_mode`). Hides `TopologySection`, `MicroInverterBanksSection`
  and `DispatchPolicySection`; shows an info-card link to Settings.
  Auto-detect banner appears when a loaded draft already uses an
  advanced feature.
- **Validation warnings** on the Auswertung tab —
  inverter oversizing (DC/AC > 1.3), bank target above battery discharge,
  minSOC above 50% of capacity, missing irradiance hint.
- About dialog now shows `appVersion (engine kEngineVersion)`.
- Wizard-created projects now seed the auto-created `sites` row with
  the wizard's lat/lon (previously fell back to the 50.0/10.0 default).

### Added — Engine
- `SimulationStep.dcKwhByArray` / `acKwhByArray` — per-array energy
  breakdown. Sums match `pvDcKwh` / `pvAcKwh` within floating-point
  tolerance.
- `stepsCsv(arrayIds: [...])` emits one `dcKwh_<id>` / `acKwh_<id>`
  column per array; identifiers are sanitised so they can't break
  the CSV delimiter.

### Changed
- App version bumped `0.1.0 → 0.2.0` to reflect the Phase 8 slice 1–3
  feature set.
- Engine version bumped `0.5.0 → 0.6.0` because `SimulationStep` and
  `stepsCsv` gained new public outputs (per-array columns); scenario/run
  rows tagged with `0.6.0` are distinguishable from the previous
  per-array-blind output.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-05-15 (engine)

- Phase 5: cyclic-convergence pre-run mode (Pro feature flag) and
  schema v3 JSON round-trip. See `docs/ROADMAP.md` for the full list.
